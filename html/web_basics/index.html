  <h1>CAPS LOCK: A Growing Problem</h1>
  <p>If you use the Internet, you are aware that <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> is a growing problem among <em>young people</em> today. Here is a list of examples where <em>young people</em> take <strong>CAPS LOCK</strong> too far:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ALEX_McLEOD_/status/558120030119141376">"SHOUTOUT TO MY MOM FOR MAKING ME GET THE MENINGITIS SHOT 2 ENSURE I WOULDN'T EVR GO VIRAL"</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/LILINTERNET/status/578963673751924736">"INSTAGRAM IS FOR PEOPLE WITH SHAREABLE LIFESTYLES.  TWITTER IS FOR PEOPLE WITH SHAREABLE IMAGINATIONS. -LIL INTERNET, SHAREABLE MEDIA LORD"</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/HotMessSWAG/status/576093278162063360">"I WANT ATTENTION 
    I WANT LOVE"</a></li>
  </ul> 
  <p>See... annoying!</p>
  <H2>Why you shouldn't use all caps:</H2>
  <ol>
    <li>It's quite annoying</li>
    <li>I'm not sure what part you're trying to emphasize</li>
    <li>Whats with all the yelling?</li>
    <li>You can't spell "shift" without "sh" as in "SHHHHHH"</li>
    <li>The little green light on your caps lock key is going to burn out</li>
  </ol>
