#JQuery study plan

1. I plan on searching google for jquery basics and seeing what comes up. hopefully finding something with stackoverflow of any other website I've noticed to be helpful and concise.
2. Once i figure out what Jquery does, I will adjust the plan as needed. Am i looking for functions and methods or sql statements? Do i get to play with variables? What are the data types i get to use? What's a coding?

3. Dive deeper into the language and write simple examples as they come up to help myself get familiar with the syntax
  * this is what i did most and taught m the most. once i learned what jQuery did, i just jumped right to this for the remaining 2 hours

4. Design a project based on the language and and execute it. 
  * This is the next release.. so off i go. It's been fun, notes.md
