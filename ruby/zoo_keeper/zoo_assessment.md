# Zoo Keeper

## first
A zoo keeper (let call him Amir) wants to track his animals based on species within their habitats. Amir wants each animal of a given species to have the following information:
  
  * gender
  * classification (mammalia, reptilia, aves)
  * weight
  * age
  * If it is a carnivore
  * does it lay eggs or give birth

Note which attributes will remain constant and which are likely to change. Which attributes inform the other and how can you re-factor that list before building the class?
Create a Class for at least 2 of each type of classification listed above and add any additional class you like. (1 per animal)

## second
Create a data structure that represents the habitats of all the animals you would like to keep together. Make sure you can not put carnivores in with herbivores so that you don't lose a zebra. 


## third
Create an rspec test for a module that can be run in any class if an animal were to have babies. Did it lay an egg or did it give a live birth? let the user know what happened. Write that module.


## fourth
Write driver code that puts a random number between 1-10 of each animal in the appropriate habitat (only 2 habitats necessary, one for carnivores and one for herbivores) and prints out a readable list of what animals are in each. something like:
`Habitat 1 contains: 5 zebra, 2 giraffe, 3 pigeons, 8 iguana`
`Habitat 2 contains: 3 lions, 2 monitor lizards, 6 falcons`

**ignore that your animals wouldn't like in the same climates**
